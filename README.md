Personal Website showcasing my writing.
the goal of your site; 
  To showcase my writing over the years, in an organized way. A website for my writing portfolio. 
the design aesthetic (visual strategy; color palette, typography)
  I wanted it to by clean and engaging. I wanted the writing to be easily available to read on site or to open in new tab to read. I choose to download fonts off googlefonts. 
the materials you used to create it (for example, the w3.css framework, templates etc.).
  I didn't use any templates but I took inspiration from some of the exampes given in the assignment tab. I did a lot of trouble shotting by looking at stackoverflow or W3schools or geeksforgeeks.
